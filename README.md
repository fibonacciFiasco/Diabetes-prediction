# Diabetes-prediction
Logistic Regression model to predict diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset.


This project uses Logistic Regression to predict whether a patient is diabetic based on medical measurements.

## Dataset
- The model uses `diabetes.csv` dataset (Pima Indians Diabetes Database).

## Steps:
1. Load and explore the dataset.
2. Split into training/testing sets.
3. Train a Logistic Regression model.
4. Evaluate model performance.
5. Predict for a sample patient.
6. Visualize outcome distribution.

## Installation
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
